    As you know, the holidays can get pretty crazy, and sometimes the thought of dirtying up the whole kitchen for a batch of showstopping Christmas cookies is the furthest thing from peace, love, and joy.     
</P>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (16.5 oz) roll sugar cookie dough</li>
    <li>2 (13 oz) vanilla pudding cups</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <h3>steps to cook</h3>
<li>Step 1</li>
<p>
    Bake cookies according to package instructions. Shortly after taking the cookies out of the oven, use the back of a spoon to make a circular indentation in the center of each cookie, working all the way to the edge. Work quickly before the cookies cool.
</p>
<li>Step 2</li>
<p>
    Fill the indentation with a shallow layer of pudding (a couple teaspoons in each) and use the spoon to smooth.
</p>
<li>Step 3</li>
<P>
    Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sugar evenly onto each cookie. Working quickly but cautiously, ignite the kitchen torch and heat the sugar until liquid and bubbly. Continue heating until the entire surface is caramelized. Serve immediately.
